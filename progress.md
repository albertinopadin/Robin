# Download Cancellation Feature - Implementation Progress

## Current Status
**Branch:** `cancel`  
**Last Commit:** Phase 2 complete (commit hash: 8e35766)  
**Status:** Phase 3 implemented but not yet committed - awaiting final testing

## Overview
Implementing download cancellation feature for Robin YouTube video downloader. The feature allows users to cancel in-progress downloads with proper cleanup and resource management.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure ✅ (Committed: 29beeb1)
- Created `DownloadState.cs` class to manage cancellation tokens
- Updated `YouTubeVideoDownloader` interface with CancellationToken support
- Modified `YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader` to support CancellationToken throughout async chain
- Added exception handling for OperationCanceledException with partial file cleanup
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Phase 2: UI Components ✅ (Committed: 8e35766)
- Added "Action" column to ListView for cancel buttons
- Implemented `AddCancelButton()` method
- Implemented `CancelDownload()` method with cancellation logic
- Added `UpdateDownloadStatus()` for UI state changes
- Added `activeDownloads` Dictionary to track downloads
- Fixed compilation issues (Button ambiguity, added DownloadState.cs to project)

### Phase 3: Polish & Integration ✅ (Implemented, NOT YET COMMITTED)
**Key additions in Phase 3:**
1. **Fixed TODO** - Can now cancel and restart downloads already in progress
2. **Enhanced error handling** - Added "Failed" status with pink background
3. **Resource management** - FormClosing handler cancels all downloads
4. **User safety** - Confirmation dialog before cancelling
5. **Better UI** - Red bold cancel button, proper control disposal
6. **Helper methods** - `CleanupDownload()`, `HideCancelButton()`

## Files Modified (Uncommitted Phase 3 Changes)

### RobinForm.cs
- Fixed restart download logic (lines 147-154)
- Enhanced `RemoveVideoItemFromDownloadsList()` with control disposal
- Added `RobinForm_FormClosing()` event handler
- Enhanced `CancelDownload()` with try-catch-finally
- Modified `AddCancelButton()` with confirmation dialog and styling
- Added `CleanupDownload()` and `HideCancelButton()` helper methods
- Added "Failed" status with visual feedback

### YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader.cs
- Enhanced exception handling to call `CleanupDownload()`
- Added failed state handling

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete implementation:**
   - Start downloads and test cancel button
   - Test cancel with confirmation dialog
   - Test restart (cancel existing and start new)
   - Test form closing with active downloads
   - Verify partial file cleanup

2. **Commit Phase 3:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Phase 3: Polish and integration for download cancellation
   
   - Fixed TODO: Can now cancel and restart in-progress downloads
   - Added confirmation dialog before cancelling
   - Enhanced error handling with Failed status
   - Added FormClosing handler to cancel all downloads
   - Improved UI with red bold cancel button
   - Added proper resource disposal and thread safety
   - Enhanced control cleanup when removing items"
   ```

3. **Merge to main branch (if desired):**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge cancel
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Cancel button appears for each download
- [ ] Confirmation dialog shows before cancelling
- [ ] Download can be cancelled mid-progress
- [ ] Cancelled downloads show grey background
- [ ] Failed downloads show pink background
- [ ] Can restart a download that's in progress
- [ ] Partial files are deleted on cancellation
- [ ] Form closing cancels all active downloads
- [ ] No memory leaks or resource issues

## Known Assumptions

1. **YoutubeExplode API** - Assumed `DownloadAsync()` accepts CancellationToken as last parameter (standard .NET pattern)
2. **Testing** - Unable to test compilation in WSL environment, relying on Visual Studio testing

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Embedded cancel buttons** - Chose buttons over context menu for discoverability
2. **Confirmation dialog** - Added for safety to prevent accidental cancellation
3. **Dictionary for state** - Used Dictionary<string, DownloadState> to track active downloads by title
4. **Visual feedback** - Different colors for different states (grey=cancelled, pink=failed)

## Architecture Summary

```
User clicks Cancel → Confirmation Dialog → CancelDownload(title)
                                               ↓
                                    CancellationTokenSource.Cancel()
                                               ↓
                                    OperationCanceledException thrown
                                               ↓
                                    Caught in DownloadVideoAsync_Explode
                                               ↓
                                    Partial file cleanup + UI update
```

## Support Files Created

- `/plans/download_cancellation_implementation_plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan
- `/scratchpads/download_cancellation_research.md` - Research notes and progress tracking
- `/Robin/DownloadState.cs` - New class for managing download state

## Notes for Next Session

- All Phase 3 changes are complete but NOT committed
- User needs to test the build before committing
- After successful test, commit Phase 3 changes
- Consider merging to main branch if feature is complete
- YoutubeExplode API assumption needs verification if downloads don't cancel properly
