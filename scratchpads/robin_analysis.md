## Research Notes
(APPEND ONLY - New entries will be added below)

### Initial Code Review - 2025-08-17

#### Architecture Overview
- WinForms application (.NET Framework 4.8) for downloading YouTube videos
- Main components:
  - RobinForm: Main UI (form with download list, progress bars)
  - YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader: Primary downloader using YoutubeExplode library
  - YouTubeVideoDownloader: Interface for video downloaders
  - RobinUpdater: ClickOnce auto-update functionality
  - RobinUtils: FFmpeg path resolution utilities
  - FastYouTube: Alternative downloader using VideoLibrary (appears unused)

#### Dependencies
- YoutubeExplode 6.5.4: Main YouTube extraction library
- VideoLibrary 3.2.9: Alternative library (FastYouTube class seems unused)
- NLog 6.0.3: Logging framework
- FFMpegCore 5.2.0: FFmpeg wrapper
- Various System packages

#### Critical Issues Found

1. **CRITICAL BUG - Path vs URL Confusion in Exception Handler**
   - Location: YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader.cs lines 191-196
   - Bug: When handling exceptions for live videos, the code incorrectly treats `videoPath` (a local file path) as a URL
   - Code: `videoPath = videoPath.Replace("/live/", "/watch?v=");`
   - Problem: videoPath is like "C:\Users\...\MyVideos\videoname.mp4" not a URL
   - This will NEVER work as intended and the exception fallback is broken

2. **Thread Safety Issue - Missing Thread Safety for ListView Updates**
   - Location: RobinForm.cs line 282-291 (AddVideoItemToDownloadsList)
   - The method modifies ListView but doesn't check InvokeRequired
   - Only the caller checks, but the method itself should be thread-safe
   - Could cause cross-thread exceptions

3. **FFmpeg Path Resolution Fragility**
   - Location: RobinUtils.cs GetPathToFFMPEG()
   - Only looks for WinGet package, doesn't fall back to bundled ffmpeg.exe
   - Throws exception if WinGet FFmpeg not found, despite having ffmpeg.exe in project
   - Should have fallback mechanism

4. **Incomplete Cancel Download Feature**
   - Location: RobinForm.cs lines 146-154
   - User gets a dialog asking to cancel, but feature not implemented
   - Shows "FEATURE NOT IMPLEMENTED" message - poor UX

5. **Progress Bar Memory Leak Potential**
   - Progress bars are added to ListView.Controls but never removed
   - When videos are removed from list, progress bars may remain

6. **Unused Classes**
   - FastYouTube class appears completely unused
   - RobinVideoDownloader is an empty class (should be removed)
   - VideoLibrary dependency seems unnecessary

#### Good Practices Observed
- Proper async/await usage for downloads
- Thread safety with InvokeRequired pattern (mostly)
- Logging with NLog
- Progress reporting during downloads
- ClickOnce auto-update support

#### Questions Answered
- Q: Why two YouTube libraries? A: FastYouTube uses VideoLibrary but appears unused
- Q: How is FFmpeg resolved? A: Only via WinGet packages, no fallback
- Q: What's the download strategy? A: YoutubeExplode with manifest, fallback without manifest

#### Potential Improvements
- Fix the critical path/URL bug
- Implement cancel download feature
- Add FFmpeg fallback mechanism
- Remove unused code
- Improve thread safety
- Add download queue management
- Better error messages

### Top 3 Improvements (Prioritized)

#### 1. FIX CRITICAL BUG: Live Video Exception Handler
**Priority: CRITICAL - Logic Error**
- **Issue**: In YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader.cs lines 191-196, the exception handler incorrectly manipulates a local file path as if it were a URL
- **Current Code**: `videoPath = videoPath.Replace("/live/", "/watch?v=");` where videoPath is "C:\...\MyVideos\video.mp4"
- **Fix**: Should manipulate the videoUrl parameter, not videoPath
- **Impact**: Live stream downloads that fail will never recover properly

#### 2. FIX: FFmpeg Path Resolution with Fallback
**Priority: HIGH - Robustness Issue**
- **Issue**: RobinUtils.GetPathToFFMPEG() only looks for WinGet FFmpeg and throws exception if not found
- **Current**: Crashes if user doesn't have FFmpeg via WinGet despite bundled ffmpeg.exe
- **Fix**: Add fallback to use bundled ffmpeg.exe when WinGet version not found
- **Impact**: Many users without WinGet FFmpeg can't use the app

#### 3. IMPLEMENT: Cancel Download Feature
**Priority: MEDIUM - UX Issue**
- **Issue**: Dialog asks user if they want to cancel download but shows "NOT IMPLEMENTED" message
- **Current**: Poor user experience with non-functional UI
- **Fix**: Implement proper cancellation using CancellationTokenSource
- **Impact**: Users can't stop unwanted downloads, must restart app
