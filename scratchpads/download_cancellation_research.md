# Download Cancellation Research Scratchpad

## Research Log
_This is an append-only scratchpad to track research, discoveries, and thinking process_

### Initial Task
Implement canceling a video download in the Robin YouTube video downloader application.

### Discovery Timeline

#### 2025-08-19 - Initial Investigation
- Starting to read all C# files to understand the current architecture
- Need to understand how downloads are currently implemented
- Looking for async patterns and how to properly implement cancellation

#### Code Analysis Complete

**Architecture Overview:**
1. **YouTubeVideoDownloader** - Interface defining the contract for video downloaders
2. **YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader** - Main implementation using YoutubeExplode library
3. **RobinForm** - Windows Forms UI that manages the download list and UI updates
4. **RobinVideoInfo** - Simple record class for video metadata

**Current Download Flow:**
1. User enters URL and clicks download or presses Enter
2. `RobinDownloadVideoWithChecks()` is called to check if video already exists
3. If new download, `DownloadVideo()` is called on the downloader
4. `YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader.DownloadVideo()` starts async download process
5. Downloads run using `Task.Run()` to avoid blocking UI
6. Progress is reported through `IProgress<double>` interface
7. UI updates are marshaled back to UI thread using `Control.Invoke()`

**Key Findings:**
- Downloads use async/await pattern with Task.Run for background execution
- YoutubeExplode's `DownloadAsync()` method at line 213-216 in YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader.cs
- Progress reporting is already implemented with IProgress<double>
- TODO comment at line 147-148 in RobinForm.cs indicates cancellation is planned but not implemented
- TODO comment at line 173-176 shows placeholder for CancelDownload() method
- Line 289 has TODO about adding cancel button to the download list
- Currently, if user tries to download same video that's already downloading, it shows message box saying feature not implemented (lines 150-154)

**Critical Methods for Download:**
- `YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader.DownloadVideoAsync_Explode()` (lines 195-219) - Main async download method
- `youtube.Videos.DownloadAsync()` - The actual YoutubeExplode download call

**Challenges Identified:**
1. Need to implement CancellationToken support throughout the async chain
2. Need to add cancel button to ListView for each download
3. Need to track active downloads and their cancellation tokens
4. Need to handle cleanup when download is cancelled
5. Need to update UI to reflect cancelled state

**Questions to Research:**
1. Does YoutubeExplode's DownloadAsync support CancellationToken? - Need to check
2. How to add buttons to ListView items in WinForms?
3. Best practice for managing multiple CancellationTokenSource instances?

#### Research on Cancellation Support

**YoutubeExplode Version:** 6.5.4 (from packages.config)

**Standard .NET Async Cancellation Pattern:**
- Use CancellationTokenSource to create cancellation tokens
- Pass CancellationToken to async methods
- Methods should check token.IsCancellationRequested periodically
- Use token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested() to throw OperationCanceledException
- Dispose CancellationTokenSource when done

**YoutubeExplode API Research:**
- Most modern async APIs in .NET support CancellationToken as final parameter
- Standard pattern would be: `DownloadAsync(..., CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`
- Need to verify if YoutubeExplode.Videos.DownloadAsync supports this

**WinForms ListView Cancel Button Options:**
1. **Owner-draw approach** - Custom draw buttons in ListView cells
2. **Embedded controls** - Add actual Button controls to ListView (already using ProgressBar this way)
3. **Context menu** - Right-click to cancel
4. **Toolbar/separate button** - Select item and click cancel

**Current Code Uses Embedded Controls:**
- Line 295-305 in RobinForm.cs shows ProgressBar being added to ListView
- Same approach can be used for Cancel button

**Managing Multiple Downloads:**
- Need Dictionary<ListViewItem, CancellationTokenSource> or similar
- Or store CancellationTokenSource in ListViewItem.Tag property
- Must dispose CancellationTokenSource after use

#### Implementation Plan Created

**Plan Location:** `/plans/download_cancellation_implementation_plan.md`

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. Use embedded cancel button approach (consistent with existing ProgressBar implementation)
2. Implement CancellationTokenSource management with Dictionary
3. Three-phase implementation: Backend, UI, Polish
4. Handle cleanup of partial files
5. Maintain thread safety throughout

**Next Steps:**
- Present plan to user for approval
- If approved, begin implementation starting with backend changes
- Verify YoutubeExplode API support for CancellationToken first

#### Phase 1 Implementation Progress

**Created DownloadState.cs:**
- Manages CancellationTokenSource for each download
- Tracks download task, URL, title, and UI element
- Includes disposal pattern for cleanup
- Added flags for completion and cancellation status

**Updated YouTubeVideoDownloader Interface:**
- Added overload method with CancellationToken parameter
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing calls

**Updated YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader Implementation:**
- Added CancellationToken parameter to all download methods
- Propagated token through entire async chain
- Added try-catch for OperationCanceledException
- Implemented cleanup of partial files on cancellation
- Added logging for cancelled downloads

**Key Changes Made:**
1. All download methods now accept optional CancellationToken
2. DownloadAsync call now passes the cancellation token
3. Exception handling cleans up partial downloads
4. Maintains backward compatibility with default parameter values

**Note:** Assuming YoutubeExplode's DownloadAsync supports CancellationToken as last parameter (standard .NET pattern)

#### Testing Notes:
- Unable to test compilation in WSL environment (msbuild/dotnet not available)
- Code changes follow standard .NET async/cancellation patterns
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Ready to commit Phase 1 changes

#### Phase 2 Implementation Complete

**UI Components Added:**
1. Added new ListView column "Action" for cancel buttons
2. Implemented AddCancelButton method to create and position buttons
3. Implemented CancelDownload method with full cancellation logic
4. Added UpdateDownloadStatus method for UI state changes
5. Integrated cancel button hiding on download completion

**Integration with Phase 1:**
1. Modified DownloadVideo to create DownloadState with CancellationTokenSource
2. Added RegisterActiveDownload method to track downloads
3. Updated YouTubeExplodeVideoDownloader to register downloads
4. Added proper exception handling for cancelled downloads

**Key UI Features:**
- Cancel button appears for each download
- Button is disabled/hidden when download completes or is cancelled
- Cancelled downloads show grey background/text
- Proper cleanup of resources on cancellation

**Ready for testing and build verification**
